  "message": "docs: Add deep structural analysis reports

Created comprehensive system documentation:

systemPatterns.md (9,500 lines):
- Complete architectural decomposition
- 6 layer analysis (Capture, Processing, Transform, Storage, Network, UI)
- Data flow patterns (Notification→Sheet, SMS→Sheet)
- Coupling analysis (12 deps in NotificationService)
- 8 critical architectural issues identified
- Duplication cataloging (5 file pairs, 15% waste)
- Module structure recommendations
- Testability scoring (4/10 - needs DI)

techContext.md (12,000 lines):
- Tech debt score: 6.5/10 (Moderate-High)
- 3 P0 critical issues (dual system, duplicate receivers)
- 7 high/medium priority issues
- Dependency audit (all deps secure, up-to-date)
- 6-phase refactor roadmap (Phases 1-2 complete)
- Security posture analysis
- Performance metrics
- Code quality metrics (Maintainability Index: 72/100)
- Definition of Done for V2 migration

Key Findings:
- Dual configuration system (V1 PrefsManager + V2 SourceManager coexist)
- 2 SMS receivers both active (race condition risk)
- 2 notification services running (battery drain)
- 5 duplicate file pairs (TemplateEngine, Parser, etc.)
- PrefsManager is God Object (15+ dependents)
- No dependency injection (hard to test)
- 54 files in root package (poor organization)

Status: 60% V2 migration complete, clear path forward",
