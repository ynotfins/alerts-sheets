  "message": "fix: Smart SMS parsing for fire alerts

CRITICAL FIX - SMS Field Mapping:

✅ Intelligent SMS Parsing:
- Detects fire alerts vs generic SMS
- Extracts address from SMS content
- Extracts city, county, state from text
- Extracts incident type (Fire, Medical, etc.)
- Parses multiple address formats

✅ Fire Alert Patterns Supported:
- 'Fire reported at 123 Main St'
- '📍 31 Grand Avenue, Cedar Knolls, NJ'
- 'Residential Fire - details'
- County detection from text

✅ Field Mapping Fixed:
- Address → Actual street address (not phone number)
- Sender → Shown in Original Body
- City/County/State → Extracted from SMS
- Type → Incident type (not just 'SMS Message')
- Details → Cleaned alert text (not full message)

BEFORE: Phone number in Address field
AFTER: Real address extracted from SMS content

Ready for real fire alert testing!",
