  "message": "fix: correct 'Include system apps' filter logic

ISSUE: Checkbox behavior was inverted
- Checked: showed ONLY system apps (excluded user apps)
- Unchecked: showed ONLY user apps

FIXED:
- Unchecked: show user apps only (default)
- Checked: show user apps + system apps (all)

Lines 224-235: simplified to single condition
Lines 256-269: updated BNN diagnostic logs

VERIFY:
- Open App Sources list
- Default view: user apps visible, BNN visible
- Check 'Include system': more apps appear, BNN still visible
- Search: works on both filtered sets",
